# escrow
Simple solidity escrow

This escrow is based on 3 roles:
supplier, customer and arbiter

As of expected, it requires 2 out of 3 votes to unlock either the payment or a refund. Additionally, if escalated to the arbiter this one can decide to split the fund to a specific partition TOTAL = A + B and assign A to supplier and B to customer.
